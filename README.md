# Catdetector

As part of Coursera’s Deep Learning Specialization, I built a logistic regression classifier to identify cats using only NumPy. This project involved flattening image data, initializing model parameters, implementing forward propagation, calculating the cost function, and applying backpropagation for training. I validated the model on test data and demonstrated its effectiveness in classifying images as “cat” or “not cat.” This experience honed my skills in logistic regression and deep learning from scratch.
